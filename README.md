*Description* :

This project involves creating a straightforward counter system utilizing an Arduino, two pushbuttons, and a 16x2 LCD display. By pressing the first button, the count increases by 10, while pressing the second button decreases it by 10. The current count is shown on the LCD screen, with a ">" symbol indicating an increment and a "<" symbol indicating a decrement. To avoid multiple counts from a single button press, the program incorporates basic debouncing with short delays. It also employs the prestate variable to ensure the count is updated only once per button press. This project is an excellent introduction to basic hardware interaction and is ideal for beginners.
